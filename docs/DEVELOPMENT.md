# Development

## Setup

On Linux, you need a POSIX shell, standard Unix utilities, `curl` with HTTPS
support, and a C compiler/linker driver available as `cc`, with system headers
and libc development files. Bootstrap requires internet access.
On Debian/Ubuntu, install the native prerequisites with
`sudo apt-get install build-essential curl ca-certificates git`.
Git on PATH with `--no-lazy-fetch` support is required (Git 2.45 or newer).
Check your installed version with `git --version`.

From the repository root:

```sh
./dev bootstrap
./dev build
```

Bootstrap installs Rust **1.99.0**, rustfmt, and Clippy, pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`. It is safe to repeat.

Use `./dev` for development commands.

Tools, dependency caches, and utilities live in `.dev/`; build outputs live in
`target/`. Both directories are ignored by Git.

## Development

For implementation, dependency, configuration, or tooling changes, run
one complete `./dev check` against the final result. Repeat it after subsequent
changes, failures, or unresolved concerns that warrant fresh validation. This is
also the CI entry point: it checks formatting, builds both executables, runs
Clippy with warnings treated as errors, and runs all tests.

For documentation-only changes, check links and anchors, examples and command
syntax, technical claims against source and existing tests, and whitespace with
`git diff --check`. Builds, application tests, Rust formatting, and Clippy are
unnecessary when executable behaviour and tooling are unchanged.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `./dev build` | Build both debug executables |
| `./dev test` | Run tests |
| `./dev test-groups` | List focused groups with their included Cargo targets |
| `./dev test-group NAME [args]` | Run a focused group with additional Cargo test arguments |
| `./dev fmt` | Format Rust source |
| `./dev fmt --check` | Check formatting |
| `./dev lint` | Run Clippy with warnings treated as errors |
| `./dev check` | Check formatting, build, test, and lint |
| `./dev cargo <args>` | Run Cargo in the local environment |
| `./dev rustc --version` | Show the compiler version |

Build, test, and lint use the committed `Cargo.lock`.

## Select tests during development

Run focused tests while implementing a change. List the available groups and
their exact targets with `./dev test-groups`, then select a capability:

```sh
./dev test-group start
./dev test-group config
./dev test-group shared
./dev test-group smoke
./dev test-group finish-planning
./dev test-group oneflow
./dev test-group hosted-oneflow
```

The groups are `start`, `save`, `finish`, `config`, `status`, `shared`,
`lifecycle`, `smoke`, `finish-planning`, `oneflow`, and `hosted-oneflow`. Command groups include
backend and CLI coverage. `smoke` pairs CLI smoke checks with development
launcher selection. `finish-planning` selects review finish planning and
eligibility coverage. `oneflow` selects direct release and hotfix command lifecycles.
`hosted-oneflow` selects version publication, separate merge-back preparation, and
fresh-process recovery for manual submission. `shared` covers the development launcher, Git boundary, repository observation,
settings, tracking, remote roles, finish-check configuration, and exact save/finish
publication. `lifecycle` includes CLI smoke checks, end-to-end project/fork
workflows, and direct and hosted release/hotfix delivery and recovery; this broad group
includes expensive lifecycle coverage. Prefer the narrower groups during fast
iteration, then run full validation before submitting changes. Every group also runs
library and binary unit tests (`--lib --bins`). Targets overlap where they
exercise shared behaviour. Overlap selects shared tests for relevant development
work; a full run uses Cargo discovery rather than executing each group.

The `finish` group does not include `cli_oneflow`, `cli_hosted_oneflow`, or
`cli_hosted_recovery`, or `cli_hosted_presentation`. For tagged release/hotfix
completion changes, also select `oneflow` and `hosted-oneflow`, or select the affected targets directly
with Cargo. Neither focused group replaces complete validation.

Choose additional targets or groups when a change affects shared components,
dependencies, configuration, or behaviour across commands. For example, settings
changes can affect planning and execution in all three lifecycle commands;
`config` alone covers settings and setup plus finish-check integration, rather
than every settings consumer. Changes to `tests/support/` can affect any target
using those fixtures. Group membership is an iteration aid, not an exhaustive
dependency map.

Use Cargo selection directly for a narrower scope. `./dev test` forwards all
arguments unchanged, including positional test-name filters, target selectors,
and test-harness arguments after `--`:

```sh
./dev test --test cli_finish
./dev test --test finish_preparation --test finish_publication
./dev test --test settings
./dev test config
./dev test --test settings remote -- --nocapture
./dev test-group finish recovery -- --nocapture
```

`./dev test config` remains a Cargo test-name filter. Groups use the separate
`test-group` command, accept one group name, and prepend Cargo target selectors
before forwarding the remaining arguments. Additional selectors can expand the
selection. An unknown or missing group fails with usage guidance.

Focused tests support iteration. The full commands, `./dev test` without
arguments and `./dev check`, run every Cargo-discovered test target, including
CLI smoke and end-to-end tests. New tests participate in full runs regardless
of group membership; update the group
definitions in `dev` when a target is useful for focused iteration.

## Test quality

Tests should detect meaningful regressions with reliable results, clear failure
diagnostics, and reasonable execution and maintenance cost. Use these principles
when adding or changing coverage:

- Verify observable behavior, documented contracts, or explicitly justified
  architectural invariants; each test should protect a meaningful case.
- Keep tests deterministic and independent of order, use the simplest adequate
  setup, and avoid coupling assertions to incidental implementation details.
- Do not duplicate equivalent assertions without a distinct regression purpose.
  Update tests when behavior changes. Defect fixes should include a regression
  case that fails with the defect and passes with the fix when practical.
- Separate expensive tests from fast iteration where practical while retaining
  them in full validation. Correct or remove obsolete, redundant, flaky, or
  consistently low-value tests. Keep reliable protection for important contracts
  when replacing flaky tests.

Detailed CLI finish and OneFlow safety scenarios exercise the shared canonical
dispatcher. Focused matrices verify both native executables and lifecycle aliases
with real effects; repeat expensive scenarios across entry points when they
protect a distinct failure mode.

Judge the suite by the important defects it catches, its reliability and
diagnostic value, and its total cost. Test count and raw coverage percentage are
not goals; keep full validation comprehensive and focused selections useful.

## Run a build

```sh
./target/debug/git-oneflow --help
./target/debug/gof status
./dev cargo run --locked -- start "add user avatars"
./dev cargo run --locked --bin gof -- --help
```

Cargo defaults to `git-oneflow`. The development launcher runs from this
project's root. To use another checkout, run a built executable from that checkout.

For optimized executables:

```sh
./dev build --release
./target/release/git-oneflow --help
./target/release/gof --version
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Rust tools or components:** repeat `./dev bootstrap`, especially
  after a toolchain change.
- **Download/certificate failure:** check network access, proxy settings, and
  system CA certificates. Bootstrap uses `sh.rustup.rs` and `static.rust-lang.org`.
- **Linker failure:** install the native compiler, linker, headers, and libc
  development files; on Debian/Ubuntu these are supplied by `build-essential`.
- **Formatting/lint failure:** run `./dev fmt`, address Clippy diagnostics, and
  repeat `./dev check`.
- **Corrupt tools/build outputs:** remove the affected tool/cache directories
  under `.dev/` and build outputs under `target/`, then bootstrap, build, and check
  again. Remove only the affected cache or tool directory; `.dev/` may also contain
  unrelated local files.

## Contributing

Keep documentation aligned with substantive changes. The [user manual](USAGE.md)
explains observable command behaviour, configuration, and recovery; the
[technical manual](ENGINEERING.md) explains implementation responsibilities,
invariants, and rationale. Update or remove superseded explanations instead of
adding change histories. Keep setup and validation instructions in this guide.

Use the validation appropriate to the change described above.
